#backdoor_implant_userland.txt
#Implant payload is dropped into specific user directory
# which will execute when that specific user logs is.
# The implant can use any extention and any filename. 
#
#Windows drive is mounted with read-write, which often 
# will require deleting hibernation file and running ntfsfix.
#Example commands:
# ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfil /dev/sdaX /mnt
# ntfsfix /dev/sdaX



#Specific user
# C:\Users\{   username  }\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\
#
#All users
# C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\



#
#automating:
#when running this attack, first ask if the payload 
# should execute when specific user (aka are we targetting specific user?)
# or should it execute whenever any user logs in. 
#if targetting specific user, first list "C:\Users" directory
# then ask which folder to drop into before unmounting. 
#
#copy payload from /home/tc/payload/
#using "start.exe" for payload name during testing to be consistent.
